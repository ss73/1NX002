# WEEK 3. EXERCISES 1. COMMENTS & DOCSTRING

## Part 1. Read some documentation

Look up some Python library/package/framework you have been using on Github, and take
a look at the documentation.

* What types of documentation are included? Can you find tutorials or other types of
instructions?
* What does the README contain?
* Look at some comments in code. Do you find them helpful?
* Locate an example of a class docstring. Does it help your understanding of the code?
* Locate an example of function or method docstring. Does it help your understanding of
the method of function?

## Part 2. Write some documentation

Follow the [template](docstring_styleguide.md) for docstring.
Add docstring to some class, method or function you wrote before this course.

## Part 3. Using the `__doc__` attribute

The docstring of a class can be accessed using the `__doc__` attribute.

* Try this out using print(`ClassName.__doc__`) for some class.
* Try reading the docstring of a method using `ClassName.method_name.__doc__`
* If you have created an object of a class, you can also access the docstring from the
object itself using `object.__doc__` or `object.method_name.__doc__`
